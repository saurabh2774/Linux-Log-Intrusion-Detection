# Linux-Log-Intrusion-Detection
Analyzed Linux authentication logs (/var/log/auth.log) to identify failed SSH login attempts, brute-force behavior, and suspicious login patterns. Used grep and awk to extract login failures, summarize attacker IPs, and generate a basic alert report. Gained hands-on experience in log analysis, threat detection, and incident documentation.
